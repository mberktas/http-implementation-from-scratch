# HTTP Implementation from Scratch

This repository provides a basic implementation of the HTTP protocol using Node.js. The code in this repository is intended to provide a deeper understanding of the underlying workings of the HTTP protocol, including request/response message format, handling of status codes, and basic error handling.

## Usage

To use this implementation, simply clone the repository and run the following command:

This will start a local server that listens for incoming HTTP requests on port 8080. To test the server, open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8080`, `http://localhost:8080/index.html`.

## Features

This implementation provides the following features:

- Basic HTTP request/response handling
- Support for GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE methods
- Handling of common HTTP status codes, including 404 and 500 errors
- Parsing of query string parameters and request bodies
- Routing of requests to appropriate handlers based on URL path
